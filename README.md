# Debian/Ubuntu SD Card Images for Single Board Computers

This repository is a bunch of scripts to build SD card images that various [single-board computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-board_computer) (SBC) can boot. Emphasis is on pureness; pure Debian and pure mainline U-boot.

## Pre-Built SD Card Images

Pre-built images ready for download are availble at [sd-card-images.johang.se](https://sd-card-images.johang.se).

## How To Use

The generated SD card images are made up of two separate images:

* **boot-BOARD.bin**: Boot image that contains partition table, U-Boot and chip-specific code. The boot image will only work on the board it's built for. The filename indicates which board it's built for.
* **debian-ARCH-VERSION-PASSWORD.bin**: Debian ext4 root filesystem image that contains a complete Debian installation, including kernel, initrd and device tree. This Debian image is generic and will work on all chips and boards with the CPU architecture it's built for. The filename indicates Debian version, CPU architecture and default root password.

These two images are the concatenated to a single image, which is then written to SD card, for example like this:

    $ zcat boot-raspberrypi_3b.bin.gz debian-buster-arm64-XXXXXX.bin.gz > sd-card.img
    # dd if=sd-card.img of=/dev/sdXXX

### Build Your Own Boot Image

To build a boot image for Raspberry Pi 3 B:

    docker build -t sd-images https://github.com/johang/sd-card-images.git
    mkdir -p /tmp/sd-images
    docker run --rm -v /tmp/sd-images:/artifacts sd-images build-boot raspberrypi_3b bcm2837 rpi_3_defconfig aarch64-linux-gnu

The image will end up in /tmp/sd-images on the host.

### Build Your Own Debian/Ubuntu Ext4 Root Filesystem Image

To build a Debian ext4 root filesystem image for arm64:

    docker build -t sd-images https://github.com/johang/sd-card-images.git
    mkdir -p /tmp/sd-images
    docker run --rm -v /tmp/sd-images:/artifacts sd-images build-debian debian arm64 buster

The image will end up in /tmp/sd-images on the host.
